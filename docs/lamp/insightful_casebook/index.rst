Insightful Casebook
====================

While the main LAMP documentation provides a comprehensive technical reference on

practical use-cases, real-world ideas, tips, and insights from actual LAMP users
and developers. It bridges the gap between learning how LAMP works and knowing how
to use it effectively for real-world network automation tasks.
