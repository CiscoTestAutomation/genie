Starting LAMP
=============

To start the LAMP interactive shell, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

   genie lamp

This will launch the LAMP shell where you can begin interacting with your network devices.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting LAMP, ensure you have:

* pyATS and Genie installed

You can either load an existing testbed YAML file or use the ``testbed add`` command to define
your devices directly within LAMP. Once your devices are configured, you can start executing
commands on them.
