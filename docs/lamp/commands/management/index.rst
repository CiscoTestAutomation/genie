Management commands
====================

Management commands facilitate testbed and device operations in the LAMP shell.
They enable loading devices, managing connections, switching between devices, and exiting the shell.
These commands streamline testbed management by allowing seamless transitions between different
devices and ensuring efficient session handling.

* :doc:`testbed` - Load devices onto LAMP shell
* :doc:`device` - Switch between devices in LAMP shell
* :doc:`close` - Exit LAMP shell
