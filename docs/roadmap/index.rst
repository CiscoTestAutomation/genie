Roadmap
=======

Governance
----------

As with all projects, time and effort is always the biggest constraint. Genie
is designed to be used by all kind Network Engineer, and as such, its
implementation and feature sets must cater to and benefit the entire user base
as much as possible.

The development team takes every precaution necessary to ensure that the test
infrastructure is free from defects, bugs & other issues. Every module
developed is be shipped with unittests, and every design intent is documented.

Genie development priority is determined based on a combination of factors and
criteria such as:

* is it a bug or an enhancement?
* is this an enabler? Eg, is this base infrastructure, or simply a feature add
  to an existing component?
* how long will it take to develop?
* how many people will likely use and/or benefit from it?
* are there any active projects/users currently waiting or blocked by it?
* are there any dependencies (from a coding/implementation perspective)?
* is there an alternative or workaround?
